## 🚀 Features

- Clean, responsive FAQ accordion card.
- Clickable questions reveal or hide answers using JavaScript.
- Interactive icons switch between plus and minus.
- Mobile-optimized layout and typography.
- Font: [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans)



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** with media queries for responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity


## 🧠 How It Works

- Questions are represented as `<span>` elements.
- When a user clicks a question, the `toggleAnswer()` JavaScript function:
  - Shows/hides the corresponding `<p>` element (answer)
  - Changes the icon from a plus to a minus (and vice versa)



## 📱 Responsive Design

The project includes media queries to optimize layout on smaller devices:

- Background image changes for mobile
- Container width is adjusted
- Font sizes and icon sizes are scaled down for better readability
